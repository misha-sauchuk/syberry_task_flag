# syberry_task_flag

To use this scrpit you must run it from command line, just like a regular python file with one parameter:
`python3.x flag.py N`, where `N` is positive even integer.

I use `class Flag` and `class JapaneseFlag` to show the principe of Inheritance in OOP. `class Flag` can be used like a parent class for any type of flags, it generate an empy flag with border and represent the result as string with `\n` separetor.

If you need to change the deminsions of the flag or type of the border symbols you must changed the constants in the top of the script.

The features with `class Flag` and constants for flag make this script supersaturated, but I think now it is **more flexible for future use**.

The full description of the requirements for this task can be found here [Japanese flag](https://github.com/paul-vasiliev/python-test-task/blob/master/README.md)
